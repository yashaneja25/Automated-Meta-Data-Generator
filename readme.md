Automated Metadata Generation System
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated metadata generation system to enhance document discoverability, classification, and analysis by producing scalable, consistent, and semantically rich metadata. The system processes unstructured documents, extracts meaningful content, and generates structured metadata outputs displayed directly on a Streamlit web interface.
Objectives

Automate Metadata Generation: Automatically generate metadata for various unstructured document types.
Content Extraction: Extract text content from diverse formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT) with optical character recognition (OCR) support where necessary.
Semantic Content Identification: Identify and leverage the most meaningful sections of documents to inform metadata generation.
Structured Metadata Creation: Produce structured metadata outputs in a standardized format.
User Interface Development: Provide an intuitive Streamlit web interface for document upload and metadata display.
System Deployment: Deploy the system for public accessibility and ease of use.

Key Features

Multi-Format Support: Processes documents in formats such as PDF, DOCX, and TXT.
OCR Integration: Extracts text from scanned or image-based documents using OCR.
Semantic Analysis: Identifies key sections and content for accurate metadata generation.
Structured Output: Generates metadata in a machine-readable format (e.g., JSON) displayed on the Streamlit interface.
Streamlit Interface: Allows users to upload documents and view generated metadata directly in the browser.
Scalable Deployment: Hosted on a cloud platform for reliability and accessibility.

System Architecture
The system comprises the following components:

Document Ingestion Module: Handles document uploads via the Streamlit interface.
Content Extraction Engine: Extracts text using format-specific parsers and OCR for image-based files.
Semantic Analysis Module: Processes extracted text to identify meaningful content using NLP techniques.
Metadata Generator: Creates structured metadata based on semantic analysis, displayed on Streamlit.
Streamlit Interface: A web-based frontend for user interaction and metadata visualization.
Backend Processing: Manages document processing without persistent metadata storage.
Deployment Infrastructure: Hosted on a cloud platform with scalability and security features.

Technology Stack

Frontend: Streamlit for the web interface.
Backend: Python for processing logic.
Content Extraction: PyPDF2, python-docx, Tesseract OCR.
Semantic Analysis: spaCy or NLTK for NLP tasks.
Deployment: Docker, AWS/GCP for hosting.
Other Tools: Git for version control, GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.9+
Tesseract OCR (for image-based document processing)
Docker (optional for containerized deployment)

Steps

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-repo/metadata-generation-system.git
cd metadata-generation-system


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure environment variables (if needed):
Create a .env file in the root directory for any API keys or configurations.


Run the Streamlit application:streamlit run app.py


Access the web interface at http://localhost:8501.

Usage

Open the Streamlit interface in a browser (http://localhost:8501).
Upload a document (PDF, DOCX, or TXT) using the file uploader.
Wait for the system to process the document and generate metadata.
View the structured metadata (e.g., JSON format) displayed directly on the Streamlit interface.

Deployment
To deploy the system:

Build a Docker image:docker build -t metadata-generation-system .


Run the container:docker run -p 8501:8501 metadata-generation-system


Configure a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP) for public access.
Set up a domain and SSL certificate for secure access.
